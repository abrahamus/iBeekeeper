    # Security Headers
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdn.jsdelivr.net; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' cdn.jsdelivr.net; connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';";
    
    # File Upload Limits
    client_max_body_size 16M;
    
    # Static Files
    location /static {
        alias /path/to/app/static;
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
    
    # File Uploads - Secure serving
    location /uploads {
        internal;  # Only allow internal redirects
        alias /path/to/uploads;
    }
    
    # Application
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    # Force HTTPS
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```
